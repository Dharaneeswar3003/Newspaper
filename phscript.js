        title: 'Mastering the Capstone: Teacher Tips and Insights for Success',
        description: 'Several teachers shared their valuable insights and advice to help students succeed with their Capstone projects. Through interviews, Ms. Vanderklippe, Mr. Raoul, Ms. Liao, and Mr. Nugent provided advice on choosing a meaningful topic, managing time, and overcoming challenges like procrastination.',
        content: `
            <p>Do you need help or inspiration for your Capstone Project? Well, no need to worry, we’ve got you covered. For this article we have interviewed Ms. Vanderklippe, Mr. Raoul, Ms. Liao, and Mr. Nugent. They have shared their wonderful advice on how to prepare and manage yourselves for Capstone. We hope this article will assist you while you are doing capstone. We asked the teachers a series of questions including their own personal opinions on the overall capstone process, what they see people struggle with the most, and what advice they would give to someone in Capstone. </p>
            <p>The four teachers were first asked about their opinions on Capstone projects and their effects on our post-secondary lives. Their opinions all narrowed down to how well it would benefit us in our post-secondary careers, only if we chose a topic that we are passionate about.  Capstone will help us “explore options beforehand” (Liao) and it “has really good long-term possibilities” (Nugent) to become a future career, especially with the time and support from our capstone teachers. However, what matters the most is that the Capstone “isn’t about completing the goal, but it’s about what we learned on the journey of doing the project” (Raoul).</p>
            <p>The second question we asked was what people struggled the most with when they were working on Capstone. Many people “don’t trust their instincts and what they want to do” (Vanderklippe). Instead, they pick an easy topic that they have no interest in and end up struggling with finding motivation.  Mr. Raoul told us that the biggest struggle for students is procrastination. For some people, they need all of the allotted time, while for others, they put things off and wait till the last minute to do things. Ms. Liao said that she sees people struggling the most with time management. Mr. Nugent explained that people have had the hardest time when picking a topic that they can follow through on.</p>
            <p>To our last question, “if you could give your major piece of advice for someone doing Capstone, what is it?” Ms. Vanderklippe said not to rush your project and to do stuff that intrigues you. She said this to encourage everyone to explore their options and this is what she believes people truly get out of Capstone. Mr. Raoul explains that organization is most important, and you can always talk to your capstone teachers for advice. He also said that for capstone, you are also supposed to have a mentor. The mentor is supposed to be someone with a lot of experience in the area of your project. Ms. Liao said that her advice is to book and attend your face-to-face meeting with your capstone teachers. She also mentioned that this is what most people forget so she highly recommends this. Mr. Nugent told us his two main points of advice were to pick a topic that you enjoy and can be serious about, and the other advice was to refrain from procrastinating.</p>
            <p>For a fun bonus question we asked the staff how Capstone has changed since they were in school. The answer was it never existed, but they all told us what they did instead. Ms. Vanderklippe explained that they had a course called consumer ed where they learned life skills to help them after high school. Mr. Raoul said that he could not recall doing anything in grade twelve, but loved that the school board added Capstone. Ms. Liao and Mr. Nugent said they both did not have Capstone or anything like it and the only thing needed for post-secondary school was good grades. So, after hearing about what the staff did in high school a question you can ask yourself is, would you want what they had or do Capstone projects?</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the Capstone project is a cornerstone of our high school experience. It is a wonderful opportunity to discover how our passions and interests can evolve into a career and affect us in the long run. The common struggle people have with this project is procrastination, and since capstone will not have any concrete deadlines, keeping a schedule for yourself will be important. Make sure you stay motivated, and you can always talk to your capstone teachers if you feel that you are falling behind.</p>

        description: 'The Senior Boys Soccer Team’s season was a mix of strong performances and missed opportunities, with key victories and narrow defeats shaping their journey. Despite falling short of their championship goals, the team’s resilience and standout players set the stage for future success.',
        content: `
            <p>The Senior Boys Soccer Team experienced a season filled with highs and lows, narrowly missing out on key opportunities but showcasing commendable individual and team performances throughout.</p>
            <p>The team opened their league campaign in commanding fashion, dominating their first two games with a decisive combined score of 15-1. However, their momentum was disrupted by a string of three consecutive one-goal losses. A notable comeback saw them defeating the first-place Kitsilano team with a hard-fought 3-1 victory.</p>
            <p>Despite the strong recovery, the close losses proved costly, leaving the team just one point shy of qualifying for the City Championships. Their season continued in the Lower Mainland Championships, where they fought hard but suffered another narrow one-goal defeat to Vancouver College, bringing their campaign to an end.</p>
            <p>When asked on his thoughts on the team's season performance, Mr. Johnston reflects,” While the season ended with frustration over missed opportunities, there were significant achievements and standout performances. Team captain Nicholas Holmes (12) led the offense as the top scorer, while assistant captains Naaim Motevaselan (12) and Markus Groves (12) made key contributions throughout the season. Goalkeeper Rio Sanchez (12), completing two seasons in the position despite initially lacking experience, delivered exceptional performances, earning recognition for his consistency and skill.</p>
            <p>While the final results fell short of their aspirations, the team demonstrated resilience, teamwork, and individual excellence, setting a strong foundation for future success.</p>

        title: 'Student Perspectives on Block Flip',
        description: 'Block flip is a controversial event with divided student opinions. Some students appreciate it for promoting fairness, as it allows all students to benefit from test hints, while others criticize it for adding stress, particularly for grade 12 students already managing heavy workloads. Despite the mixed views, block flip has been a long-standing tradition and is likely to remain in place.',
        content: '<br>Block flip has been something that receives significant attention during its annual occurrence. Student opinions on it are mixed. In one interview with a student, they noted that it is something that brings equality and fairness. They reasoned that since many courses have multiple blocks in a day, the students who have a later block hold an advantage as they can be made aware of ‘hints’ regarding a test that the students in the earlier block have already taken. With block flip, students in the earlier block will also be able to take advantage from this information. However, during another interview, the student considered it a terrible event that should be eliminated entirely. Especially as they are in grade 12, they express concern about the additional stress it creates, stating that they already have an overwhelming number of responsibilities to manage. Block flip has been present even before the introduction of the semester system, so despite divided student opinions, it is likely going to remain in place.',

        editor: 'Tara Pai (11)',
        description: 'The Lord Byng Arts Mini School, established in 1999, has provided a supportive space for artistic expression, evolving from grassroots programs in music and drama to five distinct focus areas. The program has significantly contributed to Lord Byng’s reputation as Vancouver’s top secondary school. Despite recent debates on mini schools and streaming, including a controversial decision to cancel senior Byng Arts courses in 2024, the community remains strong.',
        content: `
            <p>For the last 25 years, Lord Byng Arts Mini School has been a safe space for students to express their artistic creativity. Established in 1999 to redefine academic merit and arts education, Byng Arts has made its home school the well-respected institution it is today. The mini school has flourished over the years, expanding its grass-root programs of music and drama to make five individual focus areas where every student is able to hone their vocation. Thanks to the academic standards of the program, Lord Byng became and remains the top secondary school in the Vancouver district.</p>
            <p>In recent years, new opinions have become known on the concept of mini schools. The district has stated a determination to “root out inequality in its schools,” hoping to eliminate streaming - categorizing students based on academic performance. Tarek Haji, whose kids have attended the Point Grey mini school, defended the program in an interview with <em>The Tyee</em>, stating that mini schools provide “the perfect public school system,” and believes that “every school should have [a mini school program.]” The debate stayed under the radar of students until February 8th, 2024, when Lord Byng teachers abruptly announced the eradication of senior Byng Arts courses. The students, shocked and appalled by the sudden decision, staged a series of protests and eventually recovered one of the four terminated courses. Mr. Hartley-Folz, head of Byng Arts, has stated that he continues to be “proud” of his students for remaining “a tightly knit community” fostering the fine arts.</p>
            <p>The arts are celebrated year-round at Byng, with many opportunities for both mini school and mainstream students to participate in. The Byng Coffeehouse, held 3-4 times per year, is a recurring after-school event organized by the Byng Arts student council, and open to all who wish to attend. Students gather in the school foyer, watching their classmates exhibit their talents. From angelic singing to knee-slapping comedy, Coffeehouse is an event one couldn’t miss. When they aren’t living it up on stage, students at Byng obtain greater proficiency in the arts through elective courses. While arts electives are required for mini school students, they are equally available to mainstream students with growing interests in the arts. From renowned choirs and orchestras to thrilling theatre and media productions, every student has their chance for virtuosity.</p>
            <p>This year, as Lord Byng secondary school celebrates its’ hundred-year anniversary, Byng Arts mini school is preparing a grandiose celebration for its’ 25th. LBSO, the Lord Byng Symphony Orchestra, a long-standing group named by The Phonix as one of the “foremost [secondary school] symphony orchestras,” will be performing a composition in honour of the event. As students prepare for the upcoming jamboree, it is now more than ever that they give thanks for their program, their teachers, and all they provide. After all, it is thanks to the mini school program that Lord Byng became and remains a safe space for students to pursue their passions and express their artistic creativity.</p>

        title: 'The Stinkin’ Truth',
        editor: 'Charlie Zhang (10)',
        description: 'Lord Byng’s washrooms face ongoing complaints about poor facilities, wasteful behavior, and funding challenges. Issues like empty soap dispensers, broken sinks, and low-quality materials reflect broader resource allocation concerns. While improvements are discussed, financial constraints make significant changes unlikely without district support.',
        content: `
            <p>The story for our washrooms starts the way most mysteries do: something feels off, but you can’t quite put your finger on it. Picture a student walking to class, minding their own business, when suddenly nature calls. They pace to the nearest bathroom, most likely 2 floors away, only to enter a world most are unable to explain.The soap dispensers, empty. The sinks, far from being your allies, either unleash torrential streams of scorching hot water or stubbornly refuse to work. And the stall doors? They hang ajar like they’re inviting an audience to your now not so private moment. Somewhere in the corner, a stick figure drawn in marker stares back at you from the wall, frozen in time just like the poor student’s reaction. The question hangs in the air like the faint, ever-present odor we all try not to notice: <em> Why are the bathrooms like this? </em></p>
            <p>It’s easy to brush it off as part of the high school experience, one of those quirks we endure and laugh about later. But when you stop and think about it, you realize the issue runs deeper than an empty soap dispenser or a crooked stall door. These aren’t just inconveniences; they’re a reflection of something bigger. </p>
            <p>To get some answers, we turned to Grade 9 representative Kayeton Shum. When asked to describe the bathrooms, his answer was succinct and telling: “Stinky.” </p>
            <p>And while the smell might be the most noticeable thing for him, Shum pointed out that the real issue is what isn’t being addressed. “We’re spending fees on cleaning vandalism, but we’re not fixing the things we need, and we pay for that stuff, so the school is misusing our resources,” he said. “What about more stalls to stop lineups? Soap that doesn’t run out? Even just toilet paper that feels like more than a sliver?” </p>
            <p>His point raises an important question: is the focus on graffiti and vandalism distracting us from what really matters? </p>
            <p>Let’s take a step back. The vandalism we’re talking about isn’t catastrophic, it is not like students are breaking mirrors or tearing doors off their hinges. It’s the occasional doodle or scrawled joke, more an act of boredom than rebellion. Are these really the pressing issues that need our resources? Or are we treating symptoms while ignoring the bigger problem? </p>
            <p>Imagine what it could be if we shifted priorities. Instead of spending time and money erasing harmless stick figures which we have named and gotten attached to, let us invest in making the bathrooms a place students don’t dread walking into. Picture functioning sinks, adjustable water temperatures and everything; toilet paper that didn’t make you wince, and stall doors that actually locked. It is not just about convenience, it is about respect.</p>
            <p>And respect works both ways. If the school wants students to treat the bathrooms with respect, the school has to show respect for the students first. That means giving us facilities that feel cared for, not forgotten. After all, who’s going to feel motivated to protect something that’s already falling apart? </p>
            <p>Plus, fixing the bathrooms doesn’t just benefit the students. It’s a win-win for everyone. Better facilities mean fewer complaints, happier students, and a more positive school environment overall. Teachers wouldn’t have to deal with students constantly asking to use the bathroom in other areas of the school. Administration wouldn’t need to redirect resources to patch up frustrations. This is just about comfort; this is about creating a space that reflects the pillars and values our school wholeheartedly talks about: Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, and Responsibility </p>
            <p>The next time you step into a school bathroom and shake your hands in vain under a broken dryer, ask yourself: <em>What could this space be if we just cared enough to fix it? </em></p>
            <p>And maybe, just maybe, the answer to the mystery of our bathrooms isn’t so mysterious after all.</p>
            <p>Highschool washrooms are often a source of many student’s complaints when asked about what changes can be made at their school, ours not being an exception. Although we’re appreciative for our janitorial staff at Lord Byng and the administrators, the washrooms are still a very considerable problem. When questioned, two more of our school’s grade 9 student representatives shared their perspectives on the school’s current washroom situation. Warren Ran had a neutral opinion on this situation, stating that he thought the washrooms were fine as is. Other than possible dividers between stalls and the first-floor washrooms being busy, Ran does not think many changes need to be made.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, William Wu discussed several problems, including disproportionate stall sizes in the boys’ washrooms, as well as the lack of and waste of materials, such as paper towels. Diving deeper into these issues, Wu further addressed the issue with wasted materials, pointing out the wasteful use of paper towels during lunch. As a result, many of the washrooms, the one on the third floor in particular, do not have any more paper towels by the end of lunch. The same wasteful behaviour can be seen with tampons and toilet paper as well, which is one of the main causes for why we have cheaper materials. Next to this, another leading cause is the lack of funding. Student council gets five- thousand dollars for the years events, which includes things like food trucks and our end of the year carnival that uses up to half the funds alone. To change all the toilet paper in the school from one-ply to two-ply for only one week would use up any money the student council has left, cutting short of our fun events. Just for one week! </p>
            <p>Overall, the student council has discussed this issue on multiple occasions and have been brainstorming solutions, but they don’t believe such drastic changes can be made in a single school year. It would be exceptionally difficult for the council to make these changes unless the school board or district steps in. So, although these switches may not happen instantly, keep your eyes open for recommendations and possible solutions!</p>

        title: '2024-25 NHL Predictions',
        description: 'In the Atlantic, the Toronto Maple Leafs, Florida Panthers, and Boston Bruins are seen as top contenders, with the Panthers slightly favored due to current trends. The Metropolitan Division shows a close split between the New Jersey Devils, bolstered by improved goaltending, and the New York Rangers. The Dallas Stars lead predictions in the Central Division, while the Pacific Division sees the Edmonton Oilers favored after their strong comeback last season. With much of the season remaining, these standings are far from settled.',
        content: `
            <p>As the 2024-2025 season has been underway for about 2 months now, some sites have released their predictions for the standings of the 2024-2025 season.Sportsnet.ca, one of the sites, have released the compiled predictions of 20 responses for each division’s champion.. Starting off with the Atlantic division, surprisingly, a lot of insiders say the Toronto Maple Leafs will win the Atlantic division. Last year, the Leafs showed a strong regular season performance but could not win the division. Their cup run ended in the first round as they fell short to the Boston Bruins in 7 games. Some other insiders predict the former stanley cup champions, the Florida Panthers, will make it 2 years straight for the atlantic division. A few others said The Boston Bruins will win it, but with more than 50 games to be played in the season it is hard to tell. Based on current trends, the Panthers appear well-positioned to take the Atlantic Division. The Bruins have had a rough start to the season, with ongoing uncertainty surrounding their goaltending situation, which could hinder their chances. While the Leafs are known for their strong regular-season performances, their ability to outperform the defending Stanley Cup champions remains uncertain. It comes down to a couple of factors for the leafs: are their star players going to stand out, or are they going to stay cold? I think the core players will not outperform the defending stanley cup champions. </p>
            <p>Next is the Metropolitan division, with a surprisingly  even split between the New Jersey Devils and the New York Rangers. The Rangers last season won the Presidents Trophy, but the Devils have fixed a couple issues since last season. They have fixed their goaltending, as they acquired goaltender Jacob Markstrom from the Calgary Flames. Goaltending was their main problem last year. With the Devils addressing their goaltending issues by acquiring Jacob Markstrom, they may now have a stronger chance than the Rangers to lead the division.</p>
            <p>In the Central Division, a majority of the responses stated that Dallas Stars will win the division. The other contenders are the Nashville Predators and the Colorado Avalanche. Statistically, if the Predators and the Avalanche keep playing the way they are now, they might not even make playoffs. Both teams have had a brutal start to the season, with the Avalanche only recording 14 wins and the Predators recording 7 wins out of the 27 games.. Personally, I think the contenders should be the Dallas Stars, the Winnipeg Jets, and the Minnesota Wild. with all three teams recording more than 30 points each. All three of these teams have had strong starts to the season. I personally cannot give an answer on who will win this division, but this division will be very interesting to watch out for. </p>
            <p>Last but not least, the Pacific division, with all the insiders having the Edmonton Oilers winning the division. The Oilers made a stellar comeback last season, going from the bottom of the division to making it to the Stanley cup finals, however falling short to the Panthers in game 7. This makes a lot of insiders think that the Oilers will have another strong season and maybe even take the stanley cup home for Canada for the first time in 30 years. The Oilers have a few contenders for the division which include: the Vegas Golden Knights, the Vancouver Canucks, and the Calgary Flames. Although all these teams are currently above the Oilers in the Pacific Division standings, the Oilers have the potential to remain competitive in the fight for the division title. However, given the unpredictable nature of the division, the outcome remains uncertain.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, these predictions for the 2024-2025 NHL season reflect insights from various analysts and insiders. However, with a significant portion of the season still left to be played, these outcomes remain subject to change as teams continue to compete.</p>

            <p>What if our school was better? Lord Byng has progressively shown its shortcomings through student life challenges such as cramped hallways, pervasive vaping and frequent theft. However, through installing a travelator in the hallways, a vape detector and enhanced security measures around the school, it may be possible to rebuild a prosperous environment with eager students that are ready to embark on their studious journey and improve their quality of life.</p>
            <p>To begin, the travelator is a horizontal conveyor system used to move people efficiently from one place to another. It is most commonly found in places like the airport, shopping malls and more, where, like our school, people have destinations to reach. In Lord Byng, students often crowd in the middle of the hallways, causing immense stress for individuals to arrive in class on time. Some might argue, “but there are classrooms on each side of the hallway, not just the end and the beginning.” To address this, the travelator will leave a two student wide distance on both sides of the travelator, which is in the middle, for individuals with a shorter travel distance to simply walk towards their destination. Not only that, but the travelator will cut halfway and continue for individuals who only need to go half the distance. Furthermore, for students coming the opposite way to class there is a separate travelator next to the initial one. Lastly, because some students  misbehave and will mess up the travelator, strict rules will be set to ensure the safety of this commute. These rules consist of a monetary fine to student families if damage is done.  This rule will ensure that the school gets sufficient funding, while also efficiently allocating other students’ time to studying by reducing time wasted in hallways. </p>
            <p>The travelator will provide a safer journey to classrooms but what about the safety of our health? After all, health is critical to success. Unfortunately, our washrooms are frequently occupied by individuals who vape despite school policies. . To address this nuisance , vape detectors will be installed to identify and prevent this behaviour . The detectors would start emitting a loud beeping sound and alert school admins when vaping is detected, enabling staff to intervene appropriately.  . For extra precautions, the exits are sealed and reinforced which will then only open once a staff uses a special card to open the washroom door and report students for vaping. Through these ways, the act of vaping may be reduced within our school.</p>
            <p>Vape detectors will improve our school but one thing will still remain a persistent problem without further action; These incidents are the ever occurring thefts. One instance of theft in our school is the frequent tampering of the donation box which always gets stolen. We plan to upgrade our donation boxes by changing the exterior into bulletproof glass with a basic deterrent mechanism for money theft. These defense mechanisms consist of tamper-proof locks and internal sensors to trigger alarms to notify authorities. The consequences can include suspension as well as a note on a students’ record, possibly preventing them to progress academically,  Although there are stern consequences,  the overall goal is to disencourage theft which is an ongoing issue in our school. . Without solid consequences for the thief’s actions, it is unlikely that this behavior will come to an end. </p>
            <p>Overall, with the strategic use of the travelator, vape detectors, and a secure donation box, the implementations offer a plan to improve school life . These measures balance innovation and safety,ensuring a more efficient and positive school  life while fostering security, and encouraging positive contributions. By seamlessly integrating these features, the approach not only meets our goals of making the school more positive and efficient, but also enhances student engagement and compliance. </p>

        title: 'Record-Breaking Tour Ends in Vancouver',
        description: 'Taylor Swift’s <em>The Eras Tour</em> wrapped up its record-breaking two-year run with an unforgettable finale in Vancouver, leaving fans and the city buzzing with excitement. Vancouver embraced the Swiftie spirit with themed events, light displays, and skyrocketing bead sales for bracelet-making traditions. As the curtain falls on <em>The Eras Tour</em>, all eyes are on Swift’s next chapter—her upcoming film and much-anticipated album rereleases.',
        content: `
            <p>Since its debut in spring of 2023, Taylor Swift’s ‘The Eras Tour’ has become not only a global phenomenon with 150 tour dates all over the world but also became the highest-grossing tour of all time, with over one billion dollars in ticket sales. After a momentous two-year run, <em>The Eras Tour</em> ended in our city of Vancouver! From December sixth through eighth, thousands of fans gathered down at BC place for what certainly was a memorable end to an unforgettable tour. Though many fans are sad to see the tour end, Swift has given her fans two years' worth of memories that they will cherish forever. </p>
            <p>Since Swift’s Tour was set to end in our great city of Vancouver, local businesses and organizations had been preparing for the exciting event. Especially since studies showed that the concert will bring an estimated 157 million dollars to Vancouver’s economy, with 97 million of that spending going towards local accommodations, food, and transportation, most likely from out-of-town fans, of course Vancouver is preparing for all the business. Mayor Ken Sim stated in an interview that “This iconic event hasn’t just captivated audiences around the world, it has translated into a huge economic boost for every city it has visited, and Vancouver is no exception.” (“Economic impact of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in Vancouver estimated at ...”) The Vancouver tour dates were expected to bring an estimated 150,000 fans downtown. There were over 82,000 hotel rooms booked for that time, and many of the remaining accommodations were being listed for over a thousand dollars each. It’s not just businesses that are preparing for the chaos. Destination Downtown, a local organization, put up giant light-up signs that have been spotted around downtown and Granville Island, with the names of Swift’s songs, thirteen of them in all, including the “Vancouver” sign in Coal Harbor, which was altered to say “Swiftcouver.”  Local fans surely appreciated the city’s efforts, and I'm sure visiting fans put many of the Taylor Swift themed destinations on their itineraries.  </p>
            <p>I can’t talk about <em>The Eras Tour</em> without, of course, talking about the dedicated fans. The fans are what make each concert lively and fun, what Swift herself has said fuels her to make the music in the first place, and, of course, it is the fans who will make the economy in Vancouver explode. As mentioned before, local fans have been decorating Vancouver, planning Swiftie events, and making infinite numbers of bracelets. Michaels has noted a 300 per cent increase in bead sales and has made over 22,000 bracelets with fans through in-store classes. Fans take this tradition very seriously. Fans have other fun traditions at the concert other than friendship bracelets, too! During the concert, after Swift plays fan favorite song “Champagne Problems,” from her 2021 album <em>Evermore</em>, the whole stadium gives Swift a standing ovation. The tradition is a type of challenge. What city can give Swift the longest standing ovation? The record is approximately eight minutes from her performance at SoFi stadium in California. Vancouver did not break that record but still gave Swift amazing long ovations. Finally, this last one is not a tradition, per se, but during concert dates in Seattle, fans singing and dancing during Swift’s 2014 hit song “Shake it Off”, caused seismic activity equal to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake. It was coined the ‘Swiftquake.’ Just goes to show how devoted and spirited Swifties can be. Swift stated on the final performance night that over ten million people came to her tour over the course of two years. Swifties take extraordinary pride in their fandom, and Swift herself has spent much of her time trying to make the fandom as welcoming and fun as possible, which is certainly paying off. </p>
            <p>As someone who was able to go to the concert, I had the best time. From opener Gracie Abrams playing her new album, <em>The Secret of Us</em>, to Swift appearing in her bejeweled outfits, I can safely say that I, along with the rest of Vancouver, will not soon forget the experience. Everyone was given a glow bracelet at the gate, which created waves of colors during Swift’s songs. The whole concert was bright, fun, and nostalgic, because of Swift playing all of her old songs. Even if you were unable to obtain tickets, downtown events like “Taylor Town” in Yaletown were full of music, Taylor Swift themed activities, and like-minded fans from all over Vancouver. On night two, I was able to go outside BC place and listen to the concert. There were well over a hundred people there, all trading bracelets and singing their hearts out. Both experiences were just as magical, whether you could get tickets or not. The end to <em>The Eras Tour</em> was certainly a joyful one. </p>
            <p> So, what is next for Swift? How could she possibly do more? At the final three concerts, fans (myself included) noticed that Swift was filming herself onstage with a camera crew. The same thing happened outside of the stadium, where the fans tailgating the stadium were filmed by a similar crew with a public filming notice. What could Swift be filming for? A rerelease of her record–breaking concert film, maybe? She is also set to begin filming her directorial debut next year. It is in development right now. There still are two rerecordings of her albums to be released, of her sixth studio album Reputation, and her Self-Titled debut LP. There’s no rest for this superstar!  </p>
            <p>Amazing Statistics:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Swift played her song “All Too Well (Ten Minute Version)” live for 1,490 minutes on the tour, equivalent to over 24 hours! </li>
            <li>She performed onstage for over 520 hours, equivalent to almost twenty-two days</li>
            <li>She performed in 5 of the 7 continents: North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Australia </li>
            <li>The whole tour, from March 17, 2023, to December 8, 2024, lasted 633 days total, including tour breaks. </li>
            <li>She announced three albums over the course of the tour, <em>Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), 1989 (Taylor’s Version), and The Tortured Poets Department</em> </li>
            </ul>
