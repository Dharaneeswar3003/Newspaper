        title: 'Byng Arts: Present and Future...',
        description: 'Lord Byng is making changes to its Byng Arts program by canceling exclusive English and Social Studies classes for older students. This decision has sparked mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a step toward inclusivity, while others feel it is dismantling a program they worked hard to be part of.',
        content: `
            <p>Byng arts is a mini school program at Lord Byng secondary school that provides a fine art program with specialized English and Social Studies courses. However, due to course cuts planned by the school, we may no longer see these courses on our schedules anymore.</p>
            <p>During a course planning assembly, it was announced that Lord Byng was cancelling its Byng arts exclusive English and Social Studies for its grade 10s, 11s, and 12s, while keeping the original system for its grade 8s and 9s. This decision was criticized by many students, with the only reason being provided was to enable more students to attend schools in their catchment areas and help build connections across the entire Byng school community. </p>
            <p>Soon after this announcement, many students organized a petition to protest this decision. This petition quickly gained many signatures very quickly and now stands at 178 signatures.</p>
            <p>Even now, with the second semester starting, opinions about this cancellation are still mixed. Many arts students still disagree with the school’s decision, while other students find the cancellation to not affect them as much. We will be discussing both sides of this disagreement by interviewing the perspectives of students around our school.</p>
            <p>There are many mixed opinions about the cancellation of the Byng Arts exclusive English and social studies classes, Including some of the following pros: </p>
            <p>Some basic benefits of cancelling the Arts exclusive classes can include meeting new people. With these classes, there are less opportunities to interact or meet people in the arts as a non-Byng arts student or vice versa. </p>
            <p>The student I’ve interviewed about this cancellation is named Angel Dong, ninth grade. Dong is not a Byng Arts student although she has considered but not applied for the Byng Arts drama program. Overall, Dong is in favour of this cancellation for numerous reasons, starting with the separation of friends in these classes. Like said before, without the exclusive classes, there will be the chance of having classes with Byng Arts students as a non-Arts student, which would not have been an option with the classes still maintained. Angel Dong also feels that the Byng Arts students are more valued in ways with more fun opportunities like Arts specific trips, and more. </p>
            <p>In conclusion, Angel does not think the cancellation of these classes is too serious but prefers having the students not separated. This opinion is very common with other non-Byng Arts students that were interviewed because of the separation of current and / or potential friends and the missed opportunities as a non-Arts student. However, on the other side of the conflict, many Byng arts students have other things to say.</p>
            <p>So, here’s the thing. As a current Byng arts student, I trained for Byng arts for 4 months before getting in, working my butt off, pouring hours into getting better at something I love. I had no prior experience, just a lot of passion and a serious desire to make it into a program built for people who are serious about their craft. My hard work payed off, and I did it. I’m here. But lately, it feels like they’re slowly taking it apart, piece by piece. </p>
            <p>At first, it was little things, fewer shows, fewer events, that kind of thing. Nothing too obvious. But now? It’s becoming more and more clear. Byng Arts isn’t really Byng Arts anymore. It’s like we’re being shuffled out, little by little, like a program that was once celebrated is now quietly being dismantled. Sure, we’re still us, but piece by piece, our shared classes with our peers of the same shared passions and dedication to said passions are slowly being cancelled. First with science, and now with social studies and English. </p>
            <p>It’s not just frustrating, it’s honestly heartbreaking. Personally, The program is a huge part of me. It’s where I push myself and where I meet people who share the same interests. Now, it feels like those opportunities are being taken away, without anyone really noticing or doing anything about it.</p>
            <p>It’s clear that the school isn’t making any major announcements about the program’s future, just small, quiet changes that we’re all supposed to accept. And that’s what’s so hard about this. There’s no closure and no explanation. We’re just left to watch as the thing we’ve worked so hard for slowly disappears. The worst part is, I know this is happening to a lot of us who care about Byng Arts. We’re the ones who stuck with it, the ones who worked hard to be a part of it. Now, all that hard work feels like it’s being undermined by this slow, quiet dismantling.</p>
            <p>It feels like no one really cares. Byng Arts was more than just a program, it was a place where we, the “art” kids, had the space to grow, experiment, and find out what we’re capable of, together. It’s not just about the art,it’s also about the mindset it brought to the school, the way our shared appreciation for our interests brought us together, and the community we built as a result of it. And now, that’s all slowly slipping away. It’s clear that the program isn’t gone yet, but damage is being done, and it’s hard to ignore the fact that this isn’t just a temporary setback. Byng Arts isn’t gone,but it feels increasingly like it is. If we don’t speak up and if we don’t demand that this program gets the respect it deserves, soon there won’t be anything left to fight for. </p>

        title: 'Semester Turnaround',
        description: 'Grade 8 students at Lord Byng are feeling both excitement and nervousness as the new semester approaches. They are adjusting to the 4-course semester system, the challenges of meeting new teachers, and adapting to different schedules. Despite the uncertainties, the students are gradually settling into their high school life.',
        content: `
            <p>As the end of January approaches, a great deal of excitement and apprehension weaves through the corridors. Students’ chatter about it rises in numbers, swapping schedules, hoping they are in the same class as their best friends. Amongst them are the grade 8s, newly arrivals of Lord Byng who are still trying to figure out their place in this school.To them, semester change is a huge deal, with opinions ranging from relief to frustration.</p>
            <p>General public high schools in British Columbia follow the 4-course semester system, put in place by the Vancouver School Board (VSB). While some places in the world follow an 8-course linear system, most students have deemed the semester system to be better, and preferred it over the linear system as they would have more time to focus on the subjects. Anahita Dehghani, a grade 8 student, remarks in an interview that she agrees with the 4-course semester system because it gives her more time to learn in her subjects, and she states that the schoolwork load seems easier to focus on.</p>
            <p>Most of the interviewees responded that they feel nervous because they don’t know their teachers from semester two yet. Grade 8s have begun to embrace the change and slowly start to slip into their new high school life. However, there are still times they feel a bit doubtful and unease, like the changing timetable of semester turnaround, meeting new teachers, and adjusting to new subjects. Grade 8s have adjusted tremendously well at the beginning of the school year, and we wish them the best to continue on in semester two for their first year of their high school journey.</p>

        title: 'The Grade 8 Experience at Lord Byng',
        description: 'Starting high school can be daunting, but Grade 8 students at Lord Byng quickly adapt to their new environment. From navigating the facilities and joining extracurriculars to tackling academics and building a sense of community, their experiences shape their transition. ',
        content: `
            <p>No matter the background a student comes from, the first year of high school is always a daunting experience. To better understand the Grade 8 experience at Lord Byng Secondary from the student’s perspective, 50 surveys were handed out to students in the attempt to gather information on what grade 8 is like today. The aspects of school that affect 8th grade students have been compressed into five categories: Grounds/facilities, extracurriculars, academics, organization, and community. So what is it that makes up a new student’s school life today? </p>
            <p>When attending a high school as large as Lord Byng, students have access to a wide variety of resources and facilities. A grade 8 student stated that their first impression of Byng was that it was a “humongous” establishment, but after a few months of school “it [didn’t] feel like that” anymore. Many students take time to adapt to the larger environment, and struggle to transition to the larger grounds and greater classes. According to students surveyed, 30.4% of new students are satisfied, and 41.3% of students gave no opinion. With the large majority of students having no complaints in regards to grounds and facilities, Byng has had a positive impact on its youngest learners. In opposition, 21.7% of students rated the facilities as ‘bad,’ and 6.5% as ‘very bad.’ The justification behind the student’s displeased comments follows thus; the school bathrooms, old and unkempt, rarely lock or close at all, making the students uncomfortable during use. In addition, the school WiFi, notoriously unreliable, makes it extraordinarily difficult to complete online activities and play Kahoot, a game favoured in many grade 8 classrooms.</p>
            <p>When observing the changes one experiences when going from elementary school to high school, the vast number and varying maturity of students in high school comes to mind. Unlike younger grades, in which students perform all the same activities and gather all the same skill sets, high school allows students to focus on their passions, and expand in areas they are interested in. Grade 8 students enjoy the ability to expand on their passions through Byng’s wide variety of extracurricular activities. When questioned about their views on Byng’s club/team options, 23.4% of students rated them as ‘excellent,’ 38.4% as ‘good,’and 34% had no relevant comments. With only 4.3% of students dissatisfied with the extracurricular resources available, Byng’s Grade 8 students are appreciative of the opportunities with which they are presented. As a fine arts-focused establishment, Lord Byng offers a broad selection of fine arts courses to all students. A great misconception in younger Byng students is that the arts courses are only available to Byng Arts students. This is not true. It is instead the case that the highest level courses are enterable by audition, allowing students to “play with other people who like their hobby” as well as they do (Anonymous Byng Student.) Overall, the increased variety of clubs, sports teams, and additional programs gives students the opportunity to pursue new interests and connect with like minded students; opportunities that were not so accessible in elementary school.</p>
            <p>A major change new students face between elementary and high school is in the increase in teachers each student experiences. Going from one singular teacher to four at once, and then another four teachers the very next semester can be daunting. Furthermore, the students are expected to consume a prodigious amount of knowledge in a short period of time, creating a dramatically different, stress-filled environment much unlike the comfort of an elementary classroom. This learning system - the semester system - has been criticized by teachers and students alike for its score-centred and rushed structure. When surveyed about Byng’s academic abstrusity and structure, 40.4% rated it ‘good’, 8.5% rated it ‘excellent’, 12.8% rated it ‘bad’, 8.5% rated it ‘very bad’, and 29.8% rated ‘neutral’. With the majority of students content with Lord Byng’s academics, it is evident that the transition into higher level courses, while initially demoralizing, remains manageable.</p>
            <p>As the defining trait of any good high school, community builds the morality of a high school. Byng flourishes in regards to its community, with 29.8% of the students surveyed rated the community as ‘excellent,’ 19.1% rated it ‘good,’ 29.8% of the students surveyed showed no strong opinion and rated as ‘neutral,’ 12.8% rated it ‘bad,’ and 8.5% rated it ‘very bad.’ The preponderance of community-minded people amongst Byng students leads the survey results to favour a positive perception of the school’s community. “The people are the best part about Lord Byng,” an anonymous Byng student stated. “Since there are different classes, my friends… …vary [in] each period.”</p>
            <p>At the start of this year, several emails were sent regarding information on assemblies, lockers, and homerooms. Students also had the option to go to an orientation day, on which there was a tour and question-and-answer period. The majority of grade 8s are satisfied with Byng’s student-school communication. 25.5% of students rated Lord Byng’s organization ‘great’, 6.4% of the students stated that it was ‘excellent,’ 36.2% stated that it was ‘neutral,’ 21.3% rated it ‘bad,’ and 10.6% of the students rated it ‘very bad.’ It seems that the majority of negative responses are due to students' fear of missing information regarding their first day. Needless to say, most Grade 8s were quite nervous about grade 8, and relied on peer counselors and staff members to answer questions at school the very first day. Overall, Lord Byng’s organization when assisting new students has helped introduce new students to the school, and are urged by young students to continue to help their grade 8s transition smoothly.</p>
            <p>The daunting experience of a student’s first year of high school is greatly impacted by the school’s facilities, extracurriculars, academics, community, and events. No matter the background a student comes from, they can adapt to their new environment free from the vicissitude shown in so many typical high school films, and instead find new friends, make new memories, and have an overall wonderful experience at our school of Lord Byng.</p>

        title: 'A Scientific Guide to Productivity',
        description: 'With Semester 2 starting, it’s a great time to reflect on daily habits that impact academic performance. Small changes such as improving sleep schedules and reducing screen time can lead to better focus, productivity, and overall well-being.',
        content: `
            <p>With Semester 1 ending and Semester 2 approaching, it is about time to reflect on daily habits that may affect our academic performance. As students ourselves, we understand the challenge  of studying for multiple assessments while balancing different priorities in our lives. In this article, we aim to provide tips and advice that are based on our personal experiences and scientific proof. This can be an opportunity to boost productivity and be successful in life!</p>
            <p>One of the most overlooked and neglected aspects of daily life would have to be sleep. On average, many people sleep at 1-2 am, and wake up at roughly around 7:30 to get ready to go to school. Biologically, sleep helps to rest the mind and body. Scientifically, sleep consists of 4 stages: NREM 1, 2, 3 and REM. REM stands for restless eye movement. Each of these stages of sleep are accompanied by different waves: alpha , theta, delta and beta. The NREM stages  are present to rest our body, while REM is one of the most important stages, where the mind is being rested. With the mind getting a rest from the busy day, it can help to clear our mind and let us actually rest. When sleep duration is reduced, there is less time spent in REM, which can negatively impact cognitive functions and overall well-being.</p>
            <p>There are also some small habits which people often overlook, which may seem easier said than done. However, once you take a chance to take some action, your life will change for the better! As mentioned above, sleep is incredibly important, and it should not  be neglected. It is not just about getting enough sleep, though; maintaining a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time helps regulate the body’s internal clock.  After waking up, get out of bed immediately and start making it. Proceed with tidying up your surroundings, because a clean room equals a clean mind. Writing tasks on an agenda, or even making a simple to-do list can be beneficial. Some may prefer handwritten tasks, while some may prefer smartphone apps. Either way, any method can help structure the day effectively . These methods have worked for us, and we encourage others to take an initiative to try them out for yourselves!</p>
            <p>Personally, we have only started to develop these habits a few years ago in high school. During the later times of the pandemic, “StudyTube”, “StudyTok”, and “StudyGram” went viral in these different social media platforms, where influencers share short-form content, displaying aesthetic lifestyles and study tips in hopes to motivate others to be productive as well. Although influencers have preached these techniques, we learned that they do not work for everyone. Instead, we tried some of them ourselves before settling on a few, ensuring that they work for us in our daily lives. On top of that, addictive social media content comes with increased screen time. We all know that in this generation, almost everybody has a smartphone, and we scroll on social media way too much. Not many realize that prolonged screen time can cause physical pain on the neck, shoulder, and the back, which comes from poor posture while using all these devices. Additionally, it can negatively affects our mental health, increasing feelings of anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. Reducing screen time can improve focus and minimize distractions, leading to better productivity. Having both bad physical and mental health is detrimental to one’s productivity, so taking a break from screen time–even for a short time can be a step towards a more positive lifestyle.</p>

        description: 'Families and students gathered in the Byng auditorium for the Grade 9 Arts production, <em>Furniture Follies</em>, an 80-minute show staged like a TV sitcom. The play featured quirky humor and unexpected moments as it unfolded in a furniture store setting. With collaborative rehearsals and rapid script development, the cast delivered a standout performance that resonated with the audience.',
        content: `
            <p>On January fifteenth and sixteenth, families and students gathered in the Byng auditorium for a special performance. The production, <em>Furniture Follies</em> was an 80 minute show put on and partially written by the grade 9 Byng Arts students! If you missed the production or saw it along with many students and families at Byng, this article is here to tell you about the overall show and the process behind creating and writing it.</p>
            <p>The Byng Arts 9 students wrote the first act of the show, while the second act was written by Ian McWethy and Jason Pizzarello. The entirety of the show was directed by Matthew Thiessen, the Byng Arts Drama teacher. <em>Furniture Follies</em> takes place in a furniture store, where in each act, different stories unfold, including the store getting shut down and the internet going out. Both acts depict the antics of the customers and employees as they navigate these scenarios. The performance is unique in that it is staged like a TV sitcom, complete with a TV show opening, which allowed the actors to embrace different types of comedy and bring the production to life!</p>
            <p>Actors in the play navigated some captivating (and sometimes bizarre) situations. In one scene, wealthy duchesses lost their precious cat, only to discover it trapped inside of a couch! In another scene in Act 2, one of the employees, played by Ana Trajkovic, struggled to cope without posting pictures on social media. As a solution, she roamed the store showing printed pictures of her life to unsuspecting employees and customers.</p>
            <p>The show took the actors a small amount of time to write and rehearse, finishing the script by late October. The actors worked with their classmates in small groups to write the scenes they acted in. Clearly, a lot of work went into perfecting the show. Cast members said they were able to offer each other constructive criticism without making anyone feel diminished, which helped them grow as both performers and friends. Some mistakes discovered during rehearsals were kept in the final production, a decision that added comedic value for the audience. For example, an extra line added during the Titanic scene in Act 1 turned into a funny, quirky moment. The audience certainly agreed!</p>
            <p>“It was exhilarating for it (the performance) to be over, but it also ended too quickly,” said Hannah Corbett, one of the cast members, in an interview. She mentioned that the performance felt a bit like practice since they were already so familiar with the show from an earlier run. The crowd was respectful and kind, laughing along with friends and family. One parent noted that her family enjoyed the show just as much as they would a professional production. The actors' determination to create an enjoyable performance clearly resonated with the audience.</p>
            <p>The grade 9 drama cast delivered a fun, quirky, and standout performance, thanks to all the time and thought they put into it. Each actor’s strengths shone through, enhancing the play’s comedy and turning simple lines or mistakes into memorable highlights. The cast bonded as a group both onstage and during rehearsals, truly giving their all. I look forward to seeing more from this talented cast this school year! Special thanks to Hannah Corbett and Charli Kemper for allowing the use of their interview quotes in this article.</p>

        title: 'Mastering the Capstone: Teacher Tips and Insights for Success',
        description: 'Several teachers shared their valuable insights and advice to help students succeed with their Capstone projects. Through interviews, Ms. Vanderklippe, Mr. Raoul, Ms. Liao, and Mr. Nugent provided advice on choosing a meaningful topic, managing time, and overcoming challenges like procrastination.',
        content: `
            <p>Do you need help or inspiration for your Capstone Project? Well, no need to worry, we’ve got you covered. For this article we have interviewed Ms. Vanderklippe, Mr. Raoul, Ms. Liao, and Mr. Nugent. They have shared their wonderful advice on how to prepare and manage yourselves for Capstone. We hope this article will assist you while you are doing capstone. We asked the teachers a series of questions including their own personal opinions on the overall capstone process, what they see people struggle with the most, and what advice they would give to someone in Capstone. </p>
            <p>The four teachers were first asked about their opinions on Capstone projects and their effects on our post-secondary lives. Their opinions all narrowed down to how well it would benefit us in our post-secondary careers, only if we chose a topic that we are passionate about.  Capstone will help us “explore options beforehand” (Liao) and it “has really good long-term possibilities” (Nugent) to become a future career, especially with the time and support from our capstone teachers. However, what matters the most is that the Capstone “isn’t about completing the goal, but it’s about what we learned on the journey of doing the project” (Raoul).</p>
            <p>The second question we asked was what people struggled the most with when they were working on Capstone. Many people “don’t trust their instincts and what they want to do” (Vanderklippe). Instead, they pick an easy topic that they have no interest in and end up struggling with finding motivation.  Mr. Raoul told us that the biggest struggle for students is procrastination. For some people, they need all of the allotted time, while for others, they put things off and wait till the last minute to do things. Ms. Liao said that she sees people struggling the most with time management. Mr. Nugent explained that people have had the hardest time when picking a topic that they can follow through on.</p>
            <p>To our last question, “if you could give your major piece of advice for someone doing Capstone, what is it?” Ms. Vanderklippe said not to rush your project and to do stuff that intrigues you. She said this to encourage everyone to explore their options and this is what she believes people truly get out of Capstone. Mr. Raoul explains that organization is most important, and you can always talk to your capstone teachers for advice. He also said that for capstone, you are also supposed to have a mentor. The mentor is supposed to be someone with a lot of experience in the area of your project. Ms. Liao said that her advice is to book and attend your face-to-face meeting with your capstone teachers. She also mentioned that this is what most people forget so she highly recommends this. Mr. Nugent told us his two main points of advice were to pick a topic that you enjoy and can be serious about, and the other advice was to refrain from procrastinating.</p>
            <p>For a fun bonus question we asked the staff how Capstone has changed since they were in school. The answer was it never existed, but they all told us what they did instead. Ms. Vanderklippe explained that they had a course called consumer ed where they learned life skills to help them after high school. Mr. Raoul said that he could not recall doing anything in grade twelve, but loved that the school board added Capstone. Ms. Liao and Mr. Nugent said they both did not have Capstone or anything like it and the only thing needed for post-secondary school was good grades. So, after hearing about what the staff did in high school a question you can ask yourself is, would you want what they had or do Capstone projects?</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the Capstone project is a cornerstone of our high school experience. It is a wonderful opportunity to discover how our passions and interests can evolve into a career and affect us in the long run. The common struggle people have with this project is procrastination, and since capstone will not have any concrete deadlines, keeping a schedule for yourself will be important. Make sure you stay motivated, and you can always talk to your capstone teachers if you feel that you are falling behind.</p>

        title: 'Senior Boys Soccer Team Reflects on a Season of Resilience and Growth',
        description: 'The Senior Boys Soccer Team’s season was a mix of strong performances and missed opportunities, with key victories and narrow defeats shaping their journey. Despite falling short of their championship goals, the team’s resilience and standout players set the stage for future success.',
        content: `
            <p>The Senior Boys Soccer Team experienced a season filled with highs and lows, narrowly missing out on key opportunities but showcasing commendable individual and team performances throughout.</p>
            <p>The team opened their league campaign in commanding fashion, dominating their first two games with a decisive combined score of 15-1. However, their momentum was disrupted by a string of three consecutive one-goal losses. A notable comeback saw them defeating the first-place Kitsilano team with a hard-fought 3-1 victory.</p>
            <p>Despite the strong recovery, the close losses proved costly, leaving the team just one point shy of qualifying for the City Championships. Their season continued in the Lower Mainland Championships, where they fought hard but suffered another narrow one-goal defeat to Vancouver College, bringing their campaign to an end.</p>
            <p>When asked on his thoughts on the team's season performance, Mr. Johnston reflects,” While the season ended with frustration over missed opportunities, there were significant achievements and standout performances. Team captain Nicholas Holmes (12) led the offense as the top scorer, while assistant captains Naaim Motevaselan (12) and Markus Groves (12) made key contributions throughout the season. Goalkeeper Rio Sanchez (12), completing two seasons in the position despite initially lacking experience, delivered exceptional performances, earning recognition for his consistency and skill.</p>
            <p>While the final results fell short of their aspirations, the team demonstrated resilience, teamwork, and individual excellence, setting a strong foundation for future success.</p>

        title: 'History of Byng Arts',
        editor: 'Tara Pai (11)',
        description: 'The Lord Byng Arts Mini School, established in 1999, has provided a supportive space for artistic expression, evolving from grassroots programs in music and drama to five distinct focus areas. The program has significantly contributed to Lord Byng’s reputation as Vancouver’s top secondary school. Despite recent debates on mini schools and streaming, including a controversial decision to cancel senior Byng Arts courses in 2024, the community remains strong.',
        content: `
            <p>For the last 25 years, Lord Byng Arts Mini School has been a safe space for students to express their artistic creativity. Established in 1999 to redefine academic merit and arts education, Byng Arts has made its home school the well-respected institution it is today. The mini school has flourished over the years, expanding its grass-root programs of music and drama to make five individual focus areas where every student is able to hone their vocation. Thanks to the academic standards of the program, Lord Byng became and remains the top secondary school in the Vancouver district.</p>
            <p>In recent years, new opinions have become known on the concept of mini schools. The district has stated a determination to “root out inequality in its schools,” hoping to eliminate streaming - categorizing students based on academic performance. Tarek Haji, whose kids have attended the Point Grey mini school, defended the program in an interview with <em>The Tyee</em>, stating that mini schools provide “the perfect public school system,” and believes that “every school should have [a mini school program.]” The debate stayed under the radar of students until February 8th, 2024, when Lord Byng teachers abruptly announced the eradication of senior Byng Arts courses. The students, shocked and appalled by the sudden decision, staged a series of protests and eventually recovered one of the four terminated courses. Mr. Hartley-Folz, head of Byng Arts, has stated that he continues to be “proud” of his students for remaining “a tightly knit community” fostering the fine arts.</p>
            <p>The arts are celebrated year-round at Byng, with many opportunities for both mini school and mainstream students to participate in. The Byng Coffeehouse, held 3-4 times per year, is a recurring after-school event organized by the Byng Arts student council, and open to all who wish to attend. Students gather in the school foyer, watching their classmates exhibit their talents. From angelic singing to knee-slapping comedy, Coffeehouse is an event one couldn’t miss. When they aren’t living it up on stage, students at Byng obtain greater proficiency in the arts through elective courses. While arts electives are required for mini school students, they are equally available to mainstream students with growing interests in the arts. From renowned choirs and orchestras to thrilling theatre and media productions, every student has their chance for virtuosity.</p>
            <p>This year, as Lord Byng secondary school celebrates its’ hundred-year anniversary, Byng Arts mini school is preparing a grandiose celebration for its’ 25th. LBSO, the Lord Byng Symphony Orchestra, a long-standing group named by The Phonix as one of the “foremost [secondary school] symphony orchestras,” will be performing a composition in honour of the event. As students prepare for the upcoming jamboree, it is now more than ever that they give thanks for their program, their teachers, and all they provide. After all, it is thanks to the mini school program that Lord Byng became and remains a safe space for students to pursue their passions and express their artistic creativity.</p>

        title: 'The Stinkin’ Truth',
        editor: 'Charlie Zhang (10)',
        description: 'Lord Byng’s washrooms face ongoing complaints about poor facilities, wasteful behavior, and funding challenges. Issues like empty soap dispensers, broken sinks, and low-quality materials reflect broader resource allocation concerns. While improvements are discussed, financial constraints make significant changes unlikely without district support.',
        content: `
            <p>The story for our washrooms starts the way most mysteries do: something feels off, but you can’t quite put your finger on it. Picture a student walking to class, minding their own business, when suddenly nature calls. They pace to the nearest bathroom, most likely 2 floors away, only to enter a world most are unable to explain.The soap dispensers, empty. The sinks, far from being your allies, either unleash torrential streams of scorching hot water or stubbornly refuse to work. And the stall doors? They hang ajar like they’re inviting an audience to your now not so private moment. Somewhere in the corner, a stick figure drawn in marker stares back at you from the wall, frozen in time just like the poor student’s reaction. The question hangs in the air like the faint, ever-present odor we all try not to notice: <em> Why are the bathrooms like this? </em></p>
            <p>It’s easy to brush it off as part of the high school experience, one of those quirks we endure and laugh about later. But when you stop and think about it, you realize the issue runs deeper than an empty soap dispenser or a crooked stall door. These aren’t just inconveniences; they’re a reflection of something bigger. </p>
            <p>To get some answers, we turned to Grade 9 representative Kayeton Shum. When asked to describe the bathrooms, his answer was succinct and telling: “Stinky.” </p>
            <p>And while the smell might be the most noticeable thing for him, Shum pointed out that the real issue is what isn’t being addressed. “We’re spending fees on cleaning vandalism, but we’re not fixing the things we need, and we pay for that stuff, so the school is misusing our resources,” he said. “What about more stalls to stop lineups? Soap that doesn’t run out? Even just toilet paper that feels like more than a sliver?” </p>
            <p>His point raises an important question: is the focus on graffiti and vandalism distracting us from what really matters? </p>
            <p>Let’s take a step back. The vandalism we’re talking about isn’t catastrophic, it is not like students are breaking mirrors or tearing doors off their hinges. It’s the occasional doodle or scrawled joke, more an act of boredom than rebellion. Are these really the pressing issues that need our resources? Or are we treating symptoms while ignoring the bigger problem? </p>
            <p>Imagine what it could be if we shifted priorities. Instead of spending time and money erasing harmless stick figures which we have named and gotten attached to, let us invest in making the bathrooms a place students don’t dread walking into. Picture functioning sinks, adjustable water temperatures and everything; toilet paper that didn’t make you wince, and stall doors that actually locked. It is not just about convenience, it is about respect.</p>
            <p>And respect works both ways. If the school wants students to treat the bathrooms with respect, the school has to show respect for the students first. That means giving us facilities that feel cared for, not forgotten. After all, who’s going to feel motivated to protect something that’s already falling apart? </p>
            <p>Plus, fixing the bathrooms doesn’t just benefit the students. It’s a win-win for everyone. Better facilities mean fewer complaints, happier students, and a more positive school environment overall. Teachers wouldn’t have to deal with students constantly asking to use the bathroom in other areas of the school. Administration wouldn’t need to redirect resources to patch up frustrations. This is just about comfort; this is about creating a space that reflects the pillars and values our school wholeheartedly talks about: Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, and Responsibility </p>
            <p>The next time you step into a school bathroom and shake your hands in vain under a broken dryer, ask yourself: <em>What could this space be if we just cared enough to fix it? </em></p>
            <p>And maybe, just maybe, the answer to the mystery of our bathrooms isn’t so mysterious after all.</p>
            <p>Highschool washrooms are often a source of many student’s complaints when asked about what changes can be made at their school, ours not being an exception. Although we’re appreciative for our janitorial staff at Lord Byng and the administrators, the washrooms are still a very considerable problem. When questioned, two more of our school’s grade 9 student representatives shared their perspectives on the school’s current washroom situation. Warren Ran had a neutral opinion on this situation, stating that he thought the washrooms were fine as is. Other than possible dividers between stalls and the first-floor washrooms being busy, Ran does not think many changes need to be made.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, William Wu discussed several problems, including disproportionate stall sizes in the boys’ washrooms, as well as the lack of and waste of materials, such as paper towels. Diving deeper into these issues, Wu further addressed the issue with wasted materials, pointing out the wasteful use of paper towels during lunch. As a result, many of the washrooms, the one on the third floor in particular, do not have any more paper towels by the end of lunch. The same wasteful behaviour can be seen with tampons and toilet paper as well, which is one of the main causes for why we have cheaper materials. Next to this, another leading cause is the lack of funding. Student council gets five- thousand dollars for the years events, which includes things like food trucks and our end of the year carnival that uses up to half the funds alone. To change all the toilet paper in the school from one-ply to two-ply for only one week would use up any money the student council has left, cutting short of our fun events. Just for one week! </p>
            <p>Overall, the student council has discussed this issue on multiple occasions and have been brainstorming solutions, but they don’t believe such drastic changes can be made in a single school year. It would be exceptionally difficult for the council to make these changes unless the school board or district steps in. So, although these switches may not happen instantly, keep your eyes open for recommendations and possible solutions!</p>

        title: '2024-25 NHL Predictions',
        description: 'In the Atlantic, the Toronto Maple Leafs, Florida Panthers, and Boston Bruins are seen as top contenders, with the Panthers slightly favored due to current trends. The Metropolitan Division shows a close split between the New Jersey Devils, bolstered by improved goaltending, and the New York Rangers. The Dallas Stars lead predictions in the Central Division, while the Pacific Division sees the Edmonton Oilers favored after their strong comeback last season. With much of the season remaining, these standings are far from settled.',
        content: `
            <p>As the 2024-2025 season has been underway for about 2 months now, some sites have released their predictions for the standings of the 2024-2025 season.Sportsnet.ca, one of the sites, have released the compiled predictions of 20 responses for each division’s champion.. Starting off with the Atlantic division, surprisingly, a lot of insiders say the Toronto Maple Leafs will win the Atlantic division. Last year, the Leafs showed a strong regular season performance but could not win the division. Their cup run ended in the first round as they fell short to the Boston Bruins in 7 games. Some other insiders predict the former stanley cup champions, the Florida Panthers, will make it 2 years straight for the atlantic division. A few others said The Boston Bruins will win it, but with more than 50 games to be played in the season it is hard to tell. Based on current trends, the Panthers appear well-positioned to take the Atlantic Division. The Bruins have had a rough start to the season, with ongoing uncertainty surrounding their goaltending situation, which could hinder their chances. While the Leafs are known for their strong regular-season performances, their ability to outperform the defending Stanley Cup champions remains uncertain. It comes down to a couple of factors for the leafs: are their star players going to stand out, or are they going to stay cold? I think the core players will not outperform the defending stanley cup champions. </p>
            <p>Next is the Metropolitan division, with a surprisingly  even split between the New Jersey Devils and the New York Rangers. The Rangers last season won the Presidents Trophy, but the Devils have fixed a couple issues since last season. They have fixed their goaltending, as they acquired goaltender Jacob Markstrom from the Calgary Flames. Goaltending was their main problem last year. With the Devils addressing their goaltending issues by acquiring Jacob Markstrom, they may now have a stronger chance than the Rangers to lead the division.</p>
            <p>In the Central Division, a majority of the responses stated that Dallas Stars will win the division. The other contenders are the Nashville Predators and the Colorado Avalanche. Statistically, if the Predators and the Avalanche keep playing the way they are now, they might not even make playoffs. Both teams have had a brutal start to the season, with the Avalanche only recording 14 wins and the Predators recording 7 wins out of the 27 games.. Personally, I think the contenders should be the Dallas Stars, the Winnipeg Jets, and the Minnesota Wild. with all three teams recording more than 30 points each. All three of these teams have had strong starts to the season. I personally cannot give an answer on who will win this division, but this division will be very interesting to watch out for. </p>
            <p>Last but not least, the Pacific division, with all the insiders having the Edmonton Oilers winning the division. The Oilers made a stellar comeback last season, going from the bottom of the division to making it to the Stanley cup finals, however falling short to the Panthers in game 7. This makes a lot of insiders think that the Oilers will have another strong season and maybe even take the stanley cup home for Canada for the first time in 30 years. The Oilers have a few contenders for the division which include: the Vegas Golden Knights, the Vancouver Canucks, and the Calgary Flames. Although all these teams are currently above the Oilers in the Pacific Division standings, the Oilers have the potential to remain competitive in the fight for the division title. However, given the unpredictable nature of the division, the outcome remains uncertain.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, these predictions for the 2024-2025 NHL season reflect insights from various analysts and insiders. However, with a significant portion of the season still left to be played, these outcomes remain subject to change as teams continue to compete.</p>

            <p>What if our school was better? Lord Byng has progressively shown its shortcomings through student life challenges such as cramped hallways, pervasive vaping and frequent theft. However, through installing a travelator in the hallways, a vape detector and enhanced security measures around the school, it may be possible to rebuild a prosperous environment with eager students that are ready to embark on their studious journey and improve their quality of life.</p>
            <p>To begin, the travelator is a horizontal conveyor system used to move people efficiently from one place to another. It is most commonly found in places like the airport, shopping malls and more, where, like our school, people have destinations to reach. In Lord Byng, students often crowd in the middle of the hallways, causing immense stress for individuals to arrive in class on time. Some might argue, “but there are classrooms on each side of the hallway, not just the end and the beginning.” To address this, the travelator will leave a two student wide distance on both sides of the travelator, which is in the middle, for individuals with a shorter travel distance to simply walk towards their destination. Not only that, but the travelator will cut halfway and continue for individuals who only need to go half the distance. Furthermore, for students coming the opposite way to class there is a separate travelator next to the initial one. Lastly, because some students  misbehave and will mess up the travelator, strict rules will be set to ensure the safety of this commute. These rules consist of a monetary fine to student families if damage is done.  This rule will ensure that the school gets sufficient funding, while also efficiently allocating other students’ time to studying by reducing time wasted in hallways. </p>
            <p>The travelator will provide a safer journey to classrooms but what about the safety of our health? After all, health is critical to success. Unfortunately, our washrooms are frequently occupied by individuals who vape despite school policies. . To address this nuisance , vape detectors will be installed to identify and prevent this behaviour . The detectors would start emitting a loud beeping sound and alert school admins when vaping is detected, enabling staff to intervene appropriately.  . For extra precautions, the exits are sealed and reinforced which will then only open once a staff uses a special card to open the washroom door and report students for vaping. Through these ways, the act of vaping may be reduced within our school.</p>
            <p>Vape detectors will improve our school but one thing will still remain a persistent problem without further action; These incidents are the ever occurring thefts. One instance of theft in our school is the frequent tampering of the donation box which always gets stolen. We plan to upgrade our donation boxes by changing the exterior into bulletproof glass with a basic deterrent mechanism for money theft. These defense mechanisms consist of tamper-proof locks and internal sensors to trigger alarms to notify authorities. The consequences can include suspension as well as a note on a students’ record, possibly preventing them to progress academically,  Although there are stern consequences,  the overall goal is to disencourage theft which is an ongoing issue in our school. . Without solid consequences for the thief’s actions, it is unlikely that this behavior will come to an end. </p>
            <p>Overall, with the strategic use of the travelator, vape detectors, and a secure donation box, the implementations offer a plan to improve school life . These measures balance innovation and safety,ensuring a more efficient and positive school  life while fostering security, and encouraging positive contributions. By seamlessly integrating these features, the approach not only meets our goals of making the school more positive and efficient, but also enhances student engagement and compliance. </p>

        title: 'Student Perspectives on Block Flip',
        description: 'Block flip is a controversial event with divided student opinions. Some students appreciate it for promoting fairness, as it allows all students to benefit from test hints, while others criticize it for adding stress, particularly for grade 12 students already managing heavy workloads. Despite the mixed views, block flip has been a long-standing tradition and is likely to remain in place.',
        content: '<br>Block flip has been something that receives significant attention during its annual occurrence. Student opinions on it are mixed. In one interview with a student, they noted that it is something that brings equality and fairness. They reasoned that since many courses have multiple blocks in a day, the students who have a later block hold an advantage as they can be made aware of ‘hints’ regarding a test that the students in the earlier block have already taken. With block flip, students in the earlier block will also be able to take advantage from this information. However, during another interview, the student considered it a terrible event that should be eliminated entirely. Especially as they are in grade 12, they express concern about the additional stress it creates, stating that they already have an overwhelming number of responsibilities to manage. Block flip has been present even before the introduction of the semester system, so despite divided student opinions, it is likely going to remain in place.',

        title: 'Record-Breaking Tour Ends in Vancouver',
        description: 'Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour, one of the highest-grossing tours of all time, wrapped up its two-year global run in Vancouver with a memorable and energetic finale. With new projects on the horizon, including album rerecordings and her directorial debut, Swift continues to redefine the music industry while leaving a lasting impact on fans worldwide.',

  <p>
    Since its debut in spring of 2023, Taylor Swift’s ‘The Eras Tour’ has become not only a global phenomenon with 150 tour dates all over the world but also the highest-grossing tour of all time, with over one billion dollars in ticket sales. After a momentous two-year run, ‘The Eras Tour’ ended in our city of Vancouver! From December sixth through eighth, thousands of fans gathered down at BC Place for what was certainly a memorable end to an unforgettable tour. Though many fans are sad to see the tour end, Swift has given her fans two years' worth of memories that they will cherish forever.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since Swift’s tour was set to end in our great city of Vancouver, local businesses and organizations had been preparing for the exciting event. Studies showed that the concert would bring an estimated 157 million dollars to Vancouver’s economy—with 97 million of that spending going towards local accommodations, food, and transportation (most likely from out-of-town fans)—so the city was gearing up for all the business. Mayor Ken Sim stated in an interview, “This iconic event hasn’t just captivated audiences around the world, it has translated into a huge economic boost for every city it has visited, and Vancouver is no exception.” The Vancouver tour dates were expected to bring an estimated 150,000 fans downtown. There were over 82,000 hotel rooms booked for that time, and many of the remaining accommodations were being listed for over a thousand dollars each. Not only businesses but local organizations were preparing too; Destination Downtown put up giant light-up signs around downtown and Granville Island featuring the names of Swift’s songs—thirteen in all—including the “Vancouver” sign in Coal Harbor, which was altered to say “Swiftcouver.” Local fans appreciated the city’s efforts, and visiting fans likely added many Taylor Swift-themed destinations to their itineraries.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I can’t talk about ‘The Eras Tour’ without mentioning the dedicated fans. They are what make each concert lively and fun, and as Swift herself has said, they fuel her music. Local fans decorated Vancouver, planned Swiftie events, and made countless friendship bracelets—Michaels even noted a 300% increase in bead sales and made over 22,000 bracelets through in-store classes. During the concert, after Swift played the fan-favorite song “Champagne Problems” from her 2021 album <em>Evermore</em>, the whole stadium gave her a standing ovation—a tradition that challenges cities to give the longest ovation (with the record being about eight minutes from her SoFi Stadium performance in California). Although Vancouver didn’t break that record, Swift still received an amazing long ovation. And in Seattle, fans singing and dancing during her 2014 hit “Shake It Off” even caused seismic activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake, a phenomenon coined the ‘Swiftquake.’ Swift noted on the final performance night that over ten million people attended her tour over the course of two years, and her fans continue to take extraordinary pride in their fandom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As someone who attended the concert, I had the best time. From opener Gracie Abrams playing her new album, <em>The Secret of Us</em>, to Swift appearing in her bejeweled outfits, I can safely say that I, along with the rest of Vancouver, will not soon forget the experience. Everyone received a glow bracelet at the gate, which created waves of color during Swift’s songs. The concert was bright, fun, and nostalgic—especially with Swift playing many of her older hits. Even if you were unable to obtain tickets, downtown events like “Taylor Town” in Yaletown were full of music, Taylor Swift-themed activities, and like-minded fans from all over Vancouver. On night two, I even went outside BC Place to listen to the concert, joining over a hundred people trading bracelets and singing their hearts out. Both experiences were magical, whether you had a ticket or not, making the end of ‘The Eras Tour’ a joyful one.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, what is next for Swift? How could she possibly do more? At the final three concerts, fans (myself included) noticed that Swift was filming herself onstage with a camera crew. The same happened outside the stadium, where tailgating fans were filmed by a similar crew with a public filming notice. What could she be filming for? Perhaps a rerelease of her record–breaking concert film? She is also set to begin filming her directorial debut next year, and there are two rerecordings of her albums planned—her sixth studio album <em>Reputation</em> and her self-titled debut LP. There’s no rest for this superstar!
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Amazing Statistics:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Swift played her song “All Too Well (Ten Minute Version)” live for 1,490 minutes on the tour, equivalent to over 24 hours!
    </li>
    <li>
      She performed onstage for over 520 hours, equivalent to almost twenty-two days.
    </li>
    <li>
      She performed in 5 of the 7 continents: North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Australia.
    </li>
    <li>
      The whole tour, from March 17, 2023, to December 8, 2024, lasted 633 days total, including tour breaks.
    </li>
    <li>
      She announced three albums over the course of the tour: <em>Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)</em>, <em>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</em>, and <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>.
